# Todo

currently we support:

- [ ] health
  - [ ] max health
  - [ ] current health
- [ ] weapon
  - [ ] type
  - [ ] level
  - [ ] exp
  - [ ] max ammo
  - [ ] current ammo
- [ ] inventory
- [ ] flags

and for now this tool need to be run natively,
we except that it could support cross-platform.

from strategy wiki, profile.dat use little-endian,
idk how is the behavior on big-endian machine, since I haven't found any
endian transmute function in NX Engine.
